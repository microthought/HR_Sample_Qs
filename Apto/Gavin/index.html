    <p>Hi, my name is Gavin Dinubilo. I recently accepted a job offer in San Francisco and am looking for a nice place to move into, maybe you can help with that?</p>
    <p>I'm a recent college graduate (just this Spring), a software developer, specifically a frontend developer (js, html, css, etc.), I accepted a job at a company called <a href="https://www.sensortower.com" target="_blank">Sensor Tower</a>, and I'm moving to San Francisco from Reno, Nevada. If that's not quite enough, here's some of my social media profiles: <a href="https://www.twitter.com/gavindinubilo">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.github.com/gavindinubilo">Github</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gavindinubilo">LinkedIn</a>, and my <a href="http://www.gavin.codes">personal site</a>.</p>
    <p>I'm looking for a studio or a room in a shared apartment. My price range is between $1,000 and $2,000. If you think you can help me out please reach out to me via email: gavincodes at gmail dot com.</p>
